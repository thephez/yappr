## 2026-01-18: Data Contract Update for Private Feeds

**Task:** Update data contract with private feed document types and post modifications

**Changes made:**
1. Updated `contracts/yappr-social-contract-actual.json` with 4 new document types:
   - `followRequest` - For requesting access to a private feed (with unique index on targetId + $ownerId)
   - `privateFeedGrant` - For approved private followers (with unique indices on owner+recipient and owner+leafIndex)
   - `privateFeedRekey` - For revocation operations, marked as `canBeDeleted: false` and `mutable: false` (CRITICAL for security)
   - `privateFeedState` - For feed initialization state, marked as `canBeDeleted: false` and `mutable: false`

2. Modified `post` document type with new optional fields for private posts:
   - `encryptedContent` (bytes, max 1024) - AEAD ciphertext for private content
   - `epoch` (uint32) - Epoch number for key derivation
   - `nonce` (bytes[24]) - XChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce

3. Extended `notification` type enum with three new values:
   - `privateFeedRequest`
   - `privateFeedApproved`
   - `privateFeedRevoked`

4. Updated `lib/constants.ts`:
   - Changed `YAPPR_CONTRACT_ID` to new contract: `FNDUsTkqMQ1Wv4qhvg25VqHRnLLfCwwvw1YFMUL9iQ7e`
   - Added new document type constants: `FOLLOW_REQUEST`, `PRIVATE_FEED_GRANT`, `PRIVATE_FEED_REKEY`, `PRIVATE_FEED_STATE`

## 2026-01-19: Auto-Revoke Private Feed Access on Block (PRD §8.1)

**Task:** Implement automatic revocation of private feed access when blocking a user who is a private follower

**Changes made:**
1. Updated `lib/services/block-service.ts`:
   - Modified `blockUser()` method to check if the blocked user is a private follower
   - Added `autoRevoked?: boolean` to the return type to indicate when auto-revocation occurred
   - Added new private method `autoRevokePrivateFeedAccess()` that:
     - Checks if the blocker has a private feed enabled (via `privateFeedKeyStore.hasFeedSeed()`)
     - Queries private followers to check if the blocked user has a grant
     - Calls `privateFeedService.revokeFollower()` if the user is a private follower
     - Uses dynamic import to avoid circular dependencies
     - Fails gracefully - block succeeds even if revocation fails
   - Auto-revocation is best-effort: the block operation always succeeds, and revocation errors are logged but don't cause failure

2. Updated `hooks/use-block.ts`:
   - Modified `toggleBlock()` to handle the new `autoRevoked` response field
   - Shows appropriate toast message when auto-revocation occurs:
     - "User blocked" (normal block)
     - "User blocked and private feed access revoked" (block + auto-revoke)

**Key features per PRD §8.1:**
- Blocking a private follower automatically revokes their private feed access
- Creates proper rekey document on-chain to cryptographically revoke access
- Deletes the user's grant document
- Best-effort approach: revocation failure doesn't block the block operation
- Clear user feedback via toast notification

## 2026-01-19: Encryption Key Entry on Login (PRD §6.3)

**Task:** Add encryption key entry modal and session storage for private feed operations after login

**Changes made:**
1. Updated `lib/secure-storage.ts` with encryption key storage functions:
   - `storeEncryptionKey(identityId, encryptionKey)` - Store key in session
   - `getEncryptionKey(identityId)` - Retrieve key from session
   - `hasEncryptionKey(identityId)` - Check if key exists in session
   - `clearEncryptionKey(identityId)` - Remove key from session

2. Created `hooks/use-encryption-key-modal.ts`:
   - Zustand store for modal state management
   - `EncryptionKeyAction` type for context-specific prompts: `view_private_posts`, `create_private_post`, `manage_private_feed`, `decrypt_grant`, `generic`
   - `getEncryptionKeyActionDescription()` for human-readable action descriptions
   - `open(action, onSuccess)` and `close()` methods

3. Created `hooks/use-require-encryption-key.ts`:
   - `useRequireEncryptionKey()` hook for components needing encryption key
   - `hasEncryptionKey()` - Check if key is stored
   - `getEncryptionKeyBytes()` - Get key as Uint8Array
   - `requireEncryptionKey(action, onSuccess)` - Show modal if key missing, else proceed
   - `requireEncryptionKeyAsync(action)` - Promise-based version

4. Created `components/auth/encryption-key-modal.tsx`:
   - Modal UI for entering encryption private key (64 hex chars)
   - Validates key format and length
   - Verifies key matches identity's on-chain encryption public key
   - Shows context-aware message based on action type
   - Info box explaining session storage behavior
   - "Skip for now" option for deferring key entry
   - Link to key recovery documentation

5. Updated `components/providers.tsx`:
   - Added `EncryptionKeyModal` import and component to providers tree

6. Updated `components/settings/private-feed-settings.tsx`:
   - Added encryption key status section when private feed is enabled
   - Shows green "Key stored for this session" when key is present
   - Shows amber warning "Key not entered for this session" when missing
   - "Enter Encryption Key" button opens modal with callback to refresh status
   - Uses `useEncryptionKeyModal` hook for modal control

**Key features per PRD §6.3:**
- Users can enter encryption key after logging in to enable private feed operations
- Key is stored in session storage (cleared on logout/tab close if not "remember me")
- Modal validates key against identity's on-chain encryption public key
- Settings page shows clear status of whether key is stored for current session
- Contextual prompts explain why key is needed based on the action

## 2026-01-19: Private Feed Owner Dashboard (PRD §4.10)

**Task:** Create dashboard UI for private feed owners showing stats, epoch usage, and recent activity

**Changes made:**
1. Created `components/settings/private-feed-dashboard.tsx`:
   - New component implementing the PRD §4.10 dashboard layout
   - Only renders when private feed is enabled (returns null otherwise)
   - Includes loading skeleton state while fetching data

   **Stats Grid (3 columns):**
   - **Followers**: Count with gradient blue styling, shows X/1024 capacity
   - **Pending Requests**: Count with gradient amber styling
   - **Private Posts**: Count with gradient purple styling

   **Epoch Usage Section:**
   - Progress bar showing revocation usage (currentEpoch-1 / MAX_EPOCH-1)
   - Color-coded: green (<50%), amber (50-90%), red (>90%)
   - Warning message when usage exceeds 90%
   - Shows remaining capacity percentage when 50-90%

   **Quick Actions:**
   - "View Requests" button with pending count badge
   - "Manage Followers" button
   - Buttons scroll to respective sections using element IDs

   **Recent Activity Section:**
   - Shows last 5 activities combining approvals and revocations
   - Approvals show user avatar/name with green checkmark
   - Revocations show leaf number with red X (user info unavailable after revocation)
   - Relative timestamps (e.g., "2h ago", "3d ago")

2. Updated `app/settings/page.tsx`:
   - Imported `PrivateFeedDashboard` component
   - Added dashboard between `PrivateFeedSettings` and `PrivateFeedFollowRequests`
   - Added `id="private-feed-requests"` and `id="private-feed-followers"` wrapper divs for scroll targeting

**Key features per PRD §4.10:**
- Dashboard only visible when private feed is enabled
- Stats show followers, pending requests, and private post counts
- Epoch usage progress bar with color-coded visual feedback
- Warning banner when approaching revocation limit (>90%)
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Recent activity feed showing approvals and revocations
