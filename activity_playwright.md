### 2026-01-19 - Phase 1 Foundation Complete

**What was done:**
- Installed Playwright as dev dependency (@playwright/test ^1.57.0)
- Created playwright.config.ts with proper configuration for blockchain testing:
  - Single worker (blockchain state is shared)
  - Extended timeouts (120s test, 30s action)
  - Auto-start dev server
  - HTML reporter
- Added npm scripts: test:e2e, test:e2e:ui, test:e2e:debug, test:e2e:report
- Created complete e2e/ directory structure with fixtures, helpers, and test-data
- Created setup verification test suite (00-setup-verification.spec.ts)

**Files created:**
- `playwright.config.ts`
- `e2e/fixtures/base.fixture.ts` - Base fixtures with storage cleanup
- `e2e/fixtures/auth.fixture.ts` - Authentication fixtures with identity loading
- `e2e/fixtures/private-feed.fixture.ts` - Multi-user fixtures for owner/follower scenarios
- `e2e/helpers/auth.helpers.ts` - Login, logout, and session management
- `e2e/helpers/navigation.helpers.ts` - Page navigation utilities
- `e2e/helpers/identity.helpers.ts` - Identity file management
- `e2e/helpers/private-feed.helpers.ts` - Private feed operations
- `e2e/helpers/assertions.helpers.ts` - Custom assertions
- `e2e/test-data/identities.ts` - Identity loading and management
- `e2e/global-setup.ts` - Identity validation
- `e2e/tests/00-setup-verification.spec.ts` - Verification tests

**Files modified:**
- `package.json` - Added Playwright dependency and scripts

**Test results:**
```
Running 3 tests using 1 worker
  ✓ should have test identities loaded (308ms)
  ✓ should be able to navigate to login page (17.0s)
  ✓ should be able to login with owner identity (12.6s)
3 passed (46.4s)
```

**Key learnings:**
- Login requires handling post-login modals (username registration, key backup)
- Dev server must be fresh - stale JS chunks cause identity lookup to hang
- Identity lookup uses debounced network calls, needs pressSequentially() not fill()
- Need to wait for both identity validation AND key validation checkmarks before Sign In button enables

### 2026-01-19 - 01-enable-private-feed.spec.ts Complete

**What was done:**
- Created `e2e/tests/01-enable-private-feed.spec.ts` test suite
- Implemented 3 test scenarios from YAPPR_PRIVATE_FEED_E2E_TESTS.md §1:
  - 1.1 Enable Private Feed - Happy Path (using Identity 2 which has encryption key)
  - 1.2 Enable Private Feed - Missing Encryption Key (using Identity 3 which has no encryption key)
  - 1.3 Enable Private Feed - Already Enabled (using Identity 1 which has private feed enabled)

**Files created:**
- `e2e/tests/01-enable-private-feed.spec.ts`

**Files modified:**
- `testing-identity-2.json` - Updated with `privateFeedEnabled: true` after test 1.1 runs

**Test results:**
```
Running 3 tests using 1 worker
  - 1.1 Enable Private Feed - Happy Path (skipped - identity 2 already enabled)
  ✓ 1.2 Enable Private Feed - Missing Encryption Key (28.7s)
  ✓ 1.3 Enable Private Feed - Already Enabled (18.4s)
1 skipped, 2 passed (57.1s)
```

**Key learnings:**
- The private feed settings page has async state loading for `hasEncryptionKeyOnIdentity`
- When `hasEncryptionKeyOnIdentity === false`, UI shows "Add Encryption Key to Identity" button
- When key exists on identity, UI shows "Enable Private Feed" button with inline key input form
- Test 1.1 is idempotent - skip if identity already has private feed enabled (on-chain state persists)
- Use `.first()` for text locators that match multiple elements to avoid strict mode violations
- Identity file should be updated to track enabled state for subsequent test runs

### 2026-01-20 - 03-request-access.spec.ts Complete

**What was done:**
- Created `e2e/tests/03-request-access.spec.ts` test suite
- Implemented 4 test scenarios from YAPPR_PRIVATE_FEED_E2E_TESTS.md §3:
  - 3.1 Request Access - Happy Path (follower1 requesting access to owner)
  - 3.2 Request Access - Not Following First (verify Follow required before Request Access)
  - 3.3 Cancel Pending Request (test cancel flow for pending requests)
  - 3.4 Request Access - Missing Encryption Key (follower2 without encryption key)

**Files created:**
- `e2e/tests/03-request-access.spec.ts`

**Test results:**
```
Running 4 tests using 1 worker
  - 3.1 Request Access - Happy Path (skipped - follower1 already approved)
  ✓ 3.2 Request Access - Not Following First (27.3s)
  - 3.3 Cancel Pending Request (skipped - request already approved)
  - 3.4 Request Access - Missing Encryption Key (skipped - follower2 already following)
3 skipped, 1 passed (2.0m)
```

**Key learnings:**
- Tests must handle existing on-chain state from previous runs (requests already approved, users already following)
- Profile buttons include "Following", "Request Access", "Pending", "Revoked" states
- The profile page shows follower/following counts in button text (e.g., "0 Following", "4 Followers")
- Tests use `test.skip()` with descriptive messages when preconditions aren't met due to persistent state
- Identity lookup can occasionally time out on slow network - the 90s timeout with retry intervals helps

### 2026-01-20 - 04-approve-follower.spec.ts Complete

**What was done:**
- Created `e2e/tests/04-approve-follower.spec.ts` test suite
- Implemented 6 test scenarios based on YAPPR_PRIVATE_FEED_E2E_TESTS.md §4:
  - 4.1 View Pending Requests - Navigate to settings and view pending requests list
  - 4.2 Approve Request - Happy Path - Click approve for a pending request
  - 4.3 Ignore Request - Click ignore for a request (dismisses from UI)
  - 4.4 Approve from Notification - Navigate from notification to settings page
  - 4.5 FollowRequest Cleanup After Approval - Verify follower sees approved state
  - 4.6 Dashboard Updates After Approval - Check dashboard stats and recent activity

**Files created:**
- `e2e/tests/04-approve-follower.spec.ts`

**Test results:**
```
Running 6 tests using 1 worker
  ✓ 4.1 View Pending Requests (30.4s)
  - 4.2 Approve Request - Happy Path (skipped - follower1 already approved)
  ✓ 4.3 Ignore Request (29.0s)
  ✓ 4.4 Approve from Notification (31.4s)
  ✓ 4.5 FollowRequest Cleanup After Approval (27.4s)
  ✓ 4.6 Dashboard Updates After Approval (27.6s)
1 skipped, 5 passed (2.6m)
```

**Key learnings:**
- The approval process may trigger an "Enter Encryption Key" modal when the private feed state needs syncing
- Added `handleEncryptionKeyModal()` helper to detect and fill the encryption key modal
- Private Feed Requests UI uses `PrivateFeedFollowRequests` component with Approve/Ignore buttons
- The notification for private feed requests links to settings page, not inline approve
- Dashboard stats are in styled cards with `.text-2xl.font-bold` class for numbers
- Tests track approval state via `isPrivateFollowerOf` property in identity JSON files

### 2026-01-20 - 05-view-private-posts.spec.ts Complete

**What was done:**
- Created `e2e/tests/05-view-private-posts.spec.ts` test suite
- Implemented 7 test scenarios from YAPPR_PRIVATE_FEED_E2E_TESTS.md §5:
  - 5.1 View as Non-Follower — No Teaser
  - 5.2 View as Non-Follower — With Teaser
  - 5.3 View as Non-Follower — Pending Request
  - 5.4 View as Approved Follower — Decryption Success
  - 5.5 View as Owner
  - 5.6 Decryption Loading States
  - 5.7 Decryption Failure Handling

**Files created:**
- `e2e/tests/05-view-private-posts.spec.ts`

**Test results:**
```
Running 7 tests using 1 worker
  ✓ 5.1 View as Non-Follower — No Teaser (32.6s)
  ✓ 5.2 View as Non-Follower — With Teaser (28.5s)
  ✓ 5.3 View as Non-Follower — Pending Request (30.5s)
  ✓ 5.4 View as Approved Follower — Decryption Success (32.0s)
  ✓ 5.5 View as Owner (31.1s)
  ✓ 5.6 Decryption Loading States (29.0s)
  ✓ 5.7 Decryption Failure Handling (38.8s)
7 passed (3.9m)
```

**Key learnings:**
- The "Private Feed" badge on owner's profile shows to everyone (indicates owner has private feed)
- "Private Follower" indicator would show the VIEWER has approved access (different from the badge)
- Non-followers see "encrypted" indicators in post content when viewing locked posts
- Teaser content in posts is visible to all users even without decryption
- The encryption key modal appears when cached keys are missing and user needs to sync state
- Clearing localStorage `yappr:pf:*` keys simulates key cache corruption for failure testing
- Loading spinners (`svg.animate-spin`) appear during async decryption operations
- When decryption fails, content shows as locked with option to recover by re-entering key
