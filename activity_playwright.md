### 2026-01-19 - Phase 1 Foundation Complete

**What was done:**
- Installed Playwright as dev dependency (@playwright/test ^1.57.0)
- Created playwright.config.ts with proper configuration for blockchain testing:
  - Single worker (blockchain state is shared)
  - Extended timeouts (120s test, 30s action)
  - Auto-start dev server
  - HTML reporter
- Added npm scripts: test:e2e, test:e2e:ui, test:e2e:debug, test:e2e:report
- Created complete e2e/ directory structure with fixtures, helpers, and test-data
- Created setup verification test suite (00-setup-verification.spec.ts)

**Files created:**
- `playwright.config.ts`
- `e2e/fixtures/base.fixture.ts` - Base fixtures with storage cleanup
- `e2e/fixtures/auth.fixture.ts` - Authentication fixtures with identity loading
- `e2e/fixtures/private-feed.fixture.ts` - Multi-user fixtures for owner/follower scenarios
- `e2e/helpers/auth.helpers.ts` - Login, logout, and session management
- `e2e/helpers/navigation.helpers.ts` - Page navigation utilities
- `e2e/helpers/identity.helpers.ts` - Identity file management
- `e2e/helpers/private-feed.helpers.ts` - Private feed operations
- `e2e/helpers/assertions.helpers.ts` - Custom assertions
- `e2e/test-data/identities.ts` - Identity loading and management
- `e2e/global-setup.ts` - Identity validation
- `e2e/tests/00-setup-verification.spec.ts` - Verification tests

**Files modified:**
- `package.json` - Added Playwright dependency and scripts

**Test results:**
```
Running 3 tests using 1 worker
  ✓ should have test identities loaded (308ms)
  ✓ should be able to navigate to login page (17.0s)
  ✓ should be able to login with owner identity (12.6s)
3 passed (46.4s)
```

**Key learnings:**
- Login requires handling post-login modals (username registration, key backup)
- Dev server must be fresh - stale JS chunks cause identity lookup to hang
- Identity lookup uses debounced network calls, needs pressSequentially() not fill()
- Need to wait for both identity validation AND key validation checkmarks before Sign In button enables

### 2026-01-19 - 01-enable-private-feed.spec.ts Complete

**What was done:**
- Created `e2e/tests/01-enable-private-feed.spec.ts` test suite
- Implemented 3 test scenarios from YAPPR_PRIVATE_FEED_E2E_TESTS.md §1:
  - 1.1 Enable Private Feed - Happy Path (using Identity 2 which has encryption key)
  - 1.2 Enable Private Feed - Missing Encryption Key (using Identity 3 which has no encryption key)
  - 1.3 Enable Private Feed - Already Enabled (using Identity 1 which has private feed enabled)

**Files created:**
- `e2e/tests/01-enable-private-feed.spec.ts`

**Files modified:**
- `testing-identity-2.json` - Updated with `privateFeedEnabled: true` after test 1.1 runs

**Test results:**
```
Running 3 tests using 1 worker
  - 1.1 Enable Private Feed - Happy Path (skipped - identity 2 already enabled)
  ✓ 1.2 Enable Private Feed - Missing Encryption Key (28.7s)
  ✓ 1.3 Enable Private Feed - Already Enabled (18.4s)
1 skipped, 2 passed (57.1s)
```

**Key learnings:**
- The private feed settings page has async state loading for `hasEncryptionKeyOnIdentity`
- When `hasEncryptionKeyOnIdentity === false`, UI shows "Add Encryption Key to Identity" button
- When key exists on identity, UI shows "Enable Private Feed" button with inline key input form
- Test 1.1 is idempotent - skip if identity already has private feed enabled (on-chain state persists)
- Use `.first()` for text locators that match multiple elements to avoid strict mode violations
- Identity file should be updated to track enabled state for subsequent test runs
