## Dash Platform Integration

Yappr uses four data contracts deployed on Dash Platform:

### Main Social Contract
Core social features with 12 document types:
- `profile` - Display name, bio, location, website
- `avatar` - Avatar customization data
- `post` - Text posts (500 char limit)
- `like`, `repost`, `follow` - Social interactions
- `bookmark`, `list`, `listMember` - Collections
- `block`, `mute` - User preferences
- `notification` - User notifications

### Direct Message Contract
- `directMessage` - Encrypted messages with receiver indexing

### Hashtag Contract
- `postHashtag` - Links hashtags to posts with trending support

### Encrypted Key Backup Contract
- `encryptedKeyBackup` - Password-encrypted private keys stored on-chain

### Important: Document Ownership
Documents use `$ownerId` (automatic platform field) for ownership. Do not include custom `authorId` or `userId` fields when creating documents.

## Routes

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/` | Public homepage with platform stats |
| `/login` | Authentication |
| `/feed` | Main feed (requires auth) |
| `/explore` | Trending hashtags and posts |
| `/hashtag?tag=xxx` | Posts with specific hashtag |
| `/bookmarks` | Saved posts (requires auth) |
| `/messages` | Direct messages (requires auth) |
| `/notifications` | Notifications (requires auth) |
| `/post?id=xxx` | Post detail and thread |
| `/profile` | Current user profile (requires auth) |
| `/user?id=xxx` | User lookup by ID |
| `/settings` | User settings (requires auth) |

## Platform Scripts

```bash
# Register a contract on Dash Platform
node register-contract.js

# Register contract with specific nonce
node register-contract-with-nonce.js

# Test DPNS name resolution
node test-dpns-resolve.js
```

## Architecture Notes

### Services Layer
All Dash Platform operations go through singleton services in `lib/services/`. This provides:
- Centralized connection management
- Query caching and deduplication
- Consistent error handling
- Clean separation from UI components

### Caching
- Query cache: 2-minute TTL
- Trending cache: 5-minute TTL
- Automatic cache invalidation on writes

### Known Issues
`wait_for_state_transition_result` often times out (504) even when transactions succeed. The app handles this by assuming success if broadcast succeeded but confirmation wait times out.
