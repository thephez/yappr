# Yappr Private Feed — Playwright E2E Test Learnings

## Key Learnings

Document issues encountered, workarounds found, and tips for future implementation.

---

## Known Patterns

### Blockchain Timing
- State transitions can take 5-30 seconds
- Use `{ timeout: 60000 }` for blockchain operations
- Expect flakiness; use retry logic where needed

### Identity Management
- Test identities persist in testing-identity-X.json
- Faucet at https://faucet.thepasta.org for new identities
- PrivateFeedState is immutable - can't reset on-chain

### Session Storage
- Auth keys: `yappr_session` in localStorage
- Encryption keys: `yappr_secure_ek_{id}`
- Private feed keys: `yappr:pf:*` prefix
- Clear localStorage between tests for isolation

### Selectors
- App doesn't use data-testid attributes
- Use text content, roles, and placeholders
- See e2e_prd.md §8 for key selectors

### 2026-01-19 - Dev Server Stale State

**Issue:** Login identity lookup hung indefinitely - no spinner or checkmark appeared after typing identity ID.

**Root Cause:** The Next.js dev server had stale/corrupted JS chunks from a previous session. The 404 errors on JS files prevented React from executing properly.

**Resolution:** Kill any existing dev servers before running tests. The Playwright webServer config handles starting a fresh one.

```bash
pkill -f "next dev" || true
npm run test:e2e
```

**Tips:**
- If identity lookup seems to hang, check browser console for 404 errors on JS files
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` to debug
- The webServer config's `reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI` can cause issues if existing server is stale

### 2026-01-19 - React Input Handling

**Issue:** Using `page.fill()` didn't trigger React's onChange properly for the identity lookup debounce.

**Root Cause:** React's synthetic event system and the 500ms debounce in the login component required actual keystrokes to trigger properly.

**Resolution:** Use `pressSequentially()` instead of `fill()` for inputs that have React state updates tied to onChange.

```typescript
// Instead of:
await page.fill('#identityInput', identity.identityId);

// Use:
await page.locator('#identityInput').pressSequentially(identity.identityId, { delay: 20 });
```

**Tips:**
- Add a small delay (10-20ms) between keystrokes for reliability
- After typing, wait for the loading spinner or checkmark to appear
- The login flow has two validation checkmarks: one for identity lookup, one for key validation

---

### 2026-01-19 - Post-Login Modals

**Issue:** After successful login, the page showed username registration and key backup modals that blocked navigation.

**Root Cause:** The app prompts new users without DPNS usernames to register one, and prompts users without key backups to create one.

**Resolution:** Added `dismissPostLoginModals()` helper that clicks "Skip for now" buttons until all modals are dismissed.

```typescript
// In auth.helpers.ts
export async function dismissPostLoginModals(page: Page): Promise<void> {
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    const skipButtons = page.locator('button:has-text("Skip for now")');
    if (await skipButtons.count() === 0) break;
    try {
      await skipButtons.last().click({ timeout: 3000 });
      await page.waitForTimeout(500);
    } catch { break; }
  }
}
```

**Tips:**
- Modals may stack (key backup overlays username registration)
- Click the last "Skip for now" button first to close topmost modal
- Some test identities may already have usernames - modals won't appear for them

---

### 2026-01-19 - Login Selectors

**Issue:** PRD selectors like `input[placeholder*="Identity ID"]` didn't match actual login page.

**Root Cause:** The login page uses `#identityInput` and `#credential` IDs, and the placeholder text is longer than documented.

**Resolution:** Use element IDs instead of placeholder text:
- Identity input: `#identityInput`
- Credential input: `#credential`
- Sign In button: `button:has-text("Sign In")`
- Green checkmark: `svg.text-green-500`
- Loading spinner: `svg.animate-spin`

**Tips:**
- Always verify selectors against actual app code when tests fail
- The PRD selectors are approximations - actual code may differ

---

### 2026-01-19 - Strict Mode Text Locators

**Issue:** `page.locator('text=Some text')` failed with "strict mode violation" when multiple elements matched.

**Root Cause:** Playwright's strict mode (enabled by default) requires locators to resolve to exactly one element. Text like "Private feed is enabled" can appear in multiple places (headings, descriptions, etc.).

**Resolution:** Use `.first()` to explicitly select the first matching element:

```typescript
// Instead of:
await expect(page.locator('text=Private feed is enabled')).toBeVisible();

// Use:
await expect(page.getByText('Private feed is enabled').first()).toBeVisible();
```

**Tips:**
- Always use `.first()` or more specific selectors when testing for visible text
- Use `page.getByText()` for text matching as it provides better semantics
- Consider using `page.getByRole()` for interactive elements to be more specific

### 2026-01-19 - Async State Loading in Private Feed Settings

**Issue:** Test for "missing encryption key" flow expected UI that hadn't loaded yet.

**Root Cause:** The `PrivateFeedSettings` component loads `hasEncryptionKeyOnIdentity` asynchronously from the chain. The button changes from "Enable Private Feed" to "Add Encryption Key to Identity" after this check completes.

**Resolution:** Added wait and handled both possible UI states:

```typescript
// Wait for async check to complete
await page.waitForTimeout(3000);

const addKeyBtn = page.locator('button:has-text("Add Encryption Key to Identity")');
const enableBtn = page.locator('button:has-text("Enable Private Feed")');

const addKeyVisible = await addKeyBtn.isVisible().catch(() => false);
const enableBtnVisible = await enableBtn.isVisible().catch(() => false);

if (addKeyVisible) {
  // Case: No encryption key on identity
} else if (enableBtnVisible) {
  // Case: Has encryption key on identity
}
```

**Tips:**
- For async-loading UI, consider waiting for a stable state indicator
- Test both possible UI states when dealing with on-chain state checks
- The identity may have keys on-chain that aren't in the local JSON file

---

### 2026-01-19 - Idempotent Tests with On-Chain State

**Issue:** Test 1.1 "Enable Private Feed" would fail on second run because private feed was already enabled.

**Root Cause:** PrivateFeedState is immutable on-chain - once enabled, it can't be un-enabled without a full reset.

**Resolution:** Check local identity file for `privateFeedEnabled` flag before running enable test:

```typescript
const currentIdentity = loadIdentity(2);
if (currentIdentity.privateFeedEnabled) {
  test.skip(true, 'Identity 2 already has private feed enabled from previous run');
  return;
}
```

Also update the identity file after successful enable:
```typescript
const updatedIdentity = loadIdentity(2);
updatedIdentity.privateFeedEnabled = true;
saveIdentity(2, updatedIdentity);
```

**Tips:**
- Tests that modify on-chain state should be idempotent (skip if already done)
- Track state changes in the identity JSON files for subsequent runs
- Consider using fresh identities from faucet for truly clean state

### 2026-01-20 - Profile Page Button States

**Issue:** Request access tests needed to handle multiple possible states on the profile page.

**Root Cause:** The profile page shows different buttons based on the relationship between viewer and profile owner:
- "Follow" - when not following
- "Following" or "Unfollow" - when following
- "Request Access" - when following and owner has private feed, viewer hasn't requested
- "Pending" - when request is pending
- "Revoked" - when access was revoked (cannot re-request)
- Private follower indicator when approved

**Resolution:** Tests check for all possible states and skip appropriately:

```typescript
const isPending = await pendingBtn.isVisible({ timeout: 2000 }).catch(() => false);
const isApproved = await approvedIndicator.isVisible({ timeout: 2000 }).catch(() => false);
const isRevoked = await revokedBtn.isVisible({ timeout: 2000 }).catch(() => false);
const canRequest = await requestBtn.isVisible({ timeout: 2000 }).catch(() => false);

if (isApproved) {
  test.skip(true, 'Follower already has approved access from previous run');
  return;
}
```

**Tips:**
- Profile buttons also include follower/following counts (e.g., "0 Following", "4 Followers")
- Use `.filter({ hasText: /pattern/i })` for case-insensitive matching
- Handle both fresh and stale state gracefully with descriptive skip messages

---

### 2026-01-20 - Transient Network Failures

**Issue:** Test 3.2 failed intermittently during identity lookup with 90-second timeout.

**Root Cause:** Blockchain DAPI requests can occasionally fail or take longer than expected due to network conditions or node availability.

**Resolution:** The existing retry logic in `auth.helpers.ts` handles most cases. For truly flaky tests, consider:
1. Re-running individual tests to verify they pass
2. Using Playwright's built-in retry configuration
3. Increasing timeouts for network-heavy operations

**Tips:**
- Single test failures during identity lookup are often transient
- If a test fails once but passes on retry, it's likely network-related
- The 90s timeout with progressive intervals (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s) is sufficient for most cases

---

### 2026-01-20 - Encryption Key Modal During Approval

**Issue:** Test 4.2 (Approve Request) failed because clicking "Approve" triggered an "Enter Encryption Key" modal instead of completing the approval.

**Root Cause:** The private feed approval process requires the owner's encryption key to:
1. Sync the private feed state from chain
2. Encrypt the path keys for the new follower using ECIES

If the encryption key is not stored in the session, the UI prompts for it before proceeding.

**Resolution:** Added `handleEncryptionKeyModal()` helper function to detect and fill the modal:

```typescript
async function handleEncryptionKeyModal(page: Page, identity: { keys: { encryptionKey?: string } }): Promise<boolean> {
  const modal = page.locator('[role="dialog"]');
  if (!await modal.isVisible({ timeout: 3000 }).catch(() => false)) return false;

  const isEncryptionModal = await page.getByText(/enter.*encryption.*key/i)
    .isVisible({ timeout: 2000 }).catch(() => false);
  if (!isEncryptionModal) return false;

  // Fill in the encryption key
  const keyInput = page.locator('input[type="password"]');
  await keyInput.first().fill(identity.keys.encryptionKey);

  const saveBtn = page.locator('button').filter({ hasText: /save|confirm/i });
  await saveBtn.first().click();
  await page.waitForTimeout(3000);
  return true;
}
```

**Tips:**
- Always check for encryption key modal after operations that modify private feed state (approve, revoke)
- The modal has title "Enter Encryption Key" and an input for hex key
- After handling the modal, you may need to re-click the action button
- Test identities must have `encryptionKey` property in their `keys` object

### 2026-01-20 - Private Feed Settings Page Structure

**Issue:** Needed to understand how to interact with the Private Feed Settings page for approval tests.

**Finding:** The Private Feed Settings page (`/settings?section=privateFeed`) has multiple sections:
1. **PrivateFeedDashboard** - Shows stats (followers count, pending, posts), epoch usage, and recent activity
2. **PrivateFeedFollowRequests** - List of pending requests with Approve/Ignore buttons
3. **PrivateFeedFollowers** - List of approved followers with Revoke buttons

**Key selectors:**
- Dashboard card: `text=Your Private Feed`
- Requests section: `text=Private Feed Requests`
- Followers section: `text=Private Followers`
- Approve button: `button:has-text("Approve")`
- Ignore button: `button:has-text("Ignore")`
- Revoke button: `button:has-text("Revoke")`
- Stats numbers: `.text-2xl.font-bold`

**Tips:**
- Sections load async - wait for data with 5s+ timeout
- Request cards show user avatar, name, username, and timestamp
- Ignore just removes from UI, request stays on-chain
- Dashboard has "View Requests" and "Manage Followers" quick action buttons
