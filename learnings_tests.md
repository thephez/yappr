## 2026-01-19: WASM SDK Integration Challenges

### Issue 1: WASM Module Import Path
**Problem:** Importing `IdentityPublicKeyInCreation` directly from `@dashevo/wasm-sdk` resulted in:
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'identitypublickeyincreation_fromObject')
```

**Root Cause:** The WASM SDK exports are from the compressed bundle (`@dashevo/wasm-sdk/compressed`), and the WASM module needs to be initialized before use.

**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
import initWasm, * as wasmSdk from '@dashevo/wasm-sdk/compressed';

let wasmInitialized = false;
async function ensureWasmInitialized() {
  if (!wasmInitialized) {
    await initWasm();
    wasmInitialized = true;
  }
  return wasmSdk;
}
```

**Lesson:** Always check package.json exports and README for the correct import paths when dealing with WASM-based SDKs.

### Issue 2: IdentityPublicKeyInCreation.fromObject() Format (BUG-001 - RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Even with proper WASM initialization, `IdentityPublicKeyInCreation.fromObject()` throws `WasmDppError`.

**What Was Tried:**
1. Passing `data` as byte array: `[3, 229, 27, ...]` - Failed
2. Passing `data` as base64 string: `"A+UbPMgXMbc3MAhqN..."` - Failed
3. With `contractBounds` object - Failed
4. Without `contractBounds` (null) - Failed
5. Added `disabledAt: null` to match existing keys - Failed

**Solution Found:** Use the constructor directly instead of `fromObject()`:
```typescript
const newKey = new wasm.IdentityPublicKeyInCreation(
  newKeyId,           // id: number
  'ENCRYPTION',       // purpose: string enum
  'MEDIUM',           // securityLevel: string enum
  'ECDSA_SECP256K1',  // keyType: string enum
  false,              // readOnly: boolean
  publicKeyBytes,     // data: Uint8Array (NOT base64!)
  null,               // signature: null for new keys
  null                // contractBounds: null or ContractBounds
);
```

**Key Insight:** The constructor accepts `data` as `Uint8Array`, while `fromObject()` has undocumented validation that fails. The constructor is more lenient and works correctly.

**Lesson:** When `fromObject()` or `fromJSON()` fail with unhelpful errors, try using the constructor directly. Check the TypeScript definitions for constructor parameters.

### Issue 3: Testing Identity Setup
**Observation:** The test identities (testing-identity-1.json, testing-identity-2.json) don't have encryption keys on their identities, which is required for private feed testing.

**Impact:** Cannot test E2E flows for private feed without first adding encryption keys.

**Workaround Needed:** May need to:
1. Fix BUG-001 to add keys programmatically
2. Or manually add encryption keys to test identities via another method
3. Or create fresh test identities with encryption keys pre-configured

### Issue 4: Identity Update Security Level Requirements (BUG-002 - RESOLVED)
**Problem:** After fixing BUG-001, `sdk.identities.update()` fails with `WasmSdkError` when trying to add an encryption key.

**Context:**
- User is logged in with HIGH security level key (securityLevel=2)
- Identity has keys: MASTER (0), CRITICAL (1), HIGH (2), TRANSFER (3)
- Error occurs during `sdk.identities.update()` call

**Root Cause Confirmed:** Dash Platform requires CRITICAL (securityLevel=1) or MASTER (securityLevel=0) keys to modify identities. The HIGH (securityLevel=2) login key is insufficient.

**Solution Applied:**
1. Added `validateKeySecurityLevel()` method to validate key security level before SDK calls
2. Modified modal flow to request CRITICAL key specifically for identity updates
3. Clear UI messaging explaining why CRITICAL key is needed

**Key Code Pattern:**
```typescript
// Validate signing key has sufficient security level before calling SDK
const validation = await this.validateKeySecurityLevel(signingPrivateKeyWif, identityId);
if (!validation.isValid) {
  return { success: false, error: validation.error };
}
// Validation checks: securityLevel must be <= 1 (CRITICAL or MASTER)
```

**Status:** RESOLVED - Security level validation working correctly. A deeper SDK error (BUG-003) was discovered.

**Lesson:** Always validate key security levels before performing sensitive operations. Identity modifications require CRITICAL or MASTER keys - this is a platform-level security requirement.

### Issue 5: SDK Identity Update Still Fails After Security Fix (BUG-003 - OPEN)
**Problem:** Even with correct CRITICAL-level key, `sdk.identities.update()` still throws `WasmSdkError`.

**Context:**
- Security level validation passes: `Signing key validated: keyId=2, securityLevel=1`
- SDK call still fails with generic `WasmSdkError`

**Possible Causes:**
- Network/DAPI connectivity issues
- SDK version incompatibility with current platform state
- Missing or invalid state transition parameters
- Platform-specific validation failures

**Status:** OPEN - Needs further investigation into SDK/platform requirements.

**Lesson:** Even when client-side validation passes, SDK operations can fail for platform-specific reasons. Better error handling and messages from the SDK would help diagnose these issues.

### Best Practices Identified

1. **Always restart dev server after code changes** - The dev server often enters a corrupted state after changes to service files.

2. **Use browser console logs extensively** - Add detailed logging before/after SDK calls to pinpoint exactly where failures occur.

3. **Compare with working examples** - Look at how existing keys are formatted in `identity.toJSON()` to understand expected formats.

4. **Document SDK integration patterns** - The Dash Platform SDK has specific patterns that aren't always obvious from TypeScript types alone.

5. **Try constructors when fromObject/fromJSON fail** - The WASM SDK's `fromObject()` and `fromJSON()` methods often have undocumented validation. Constructors are more predictable.

6. **Check security level requirements** - Different Dash Platform operations require different security level keys. Identity updates may need CRITICAL or MASTER keys.


## Developer extra learnings
**IMPORTANT** I was able register a new key to my identity via the evo-sdk on dev.11. I've confirmed on v2 of the sdk, it was borked. It seems likely that we will need to update to dev.11 of the sdk.

### Issue 6: SDK dev.11 Requires MASTER Key for Identity Updates (NOT CRITICAL)
**Problem:** When attempting to add an encryption key to identity, using CRITICAL key resulted in error:
```
Identity modifications require a MASTER key. You provided a CRITICAL key.
```

**Context:**
- UI states "CRITICAL or MASTER" key is accepted
- CRITICAL key (securityLevel=1) was validated and accepted client-side
- SDK rejected the CRITICAL key during `sdk.identities.update()`

**Discovery:** SDK dev.11 has changed the security requirements for identity modifications. Only MASTER (securityLevel=0) keys are now accepted, not CRITICAL (securityLevel=1).

**Solution:** Use MASTER key instead of CRITICAL for identity modifications.

**UI Consideration:** The modal UI mentions "CRITICAL or MASTER" but should perhaps emphasize MASTER is required, or update the validation to only accept MASTER keys.

**Lesson:** Always verify SDK behavior changes between versions. Security level requirements may change.

### Issue 7: Encryption Key Storage Location
**Observation:** After adding encryption key to identity, the private key is stored in localStorage with the key format:
```
yappr_secure_ek_<identityId>
```

**Value format:** JSON-encoded hex string (with quotes): `"81661572aae449..."`

**Usage:** When enabling private feed, the user must re-enter this key if it's not already in session storage. The key can be retrieved from localStorage for testing purposes.

**Lesson:** For E2E testing, the encryption key can be extracted from localStorage using browser console or Playwright evaluate functions.

### Issue 8: Private Feed Enable Flow Requires Key Entry
**Observation:** Even after successfully adding an encryption key to the identity on-chain, the "Enable Private Feed" button requires the user to re-enter the encryption private key (32 bytes hex).

**Flow:**
1. Add encryption key to identity (stores in localStorage as side effect)
2. Click "Enable Private Feed"
3. Modal prompts for encryption private key hex
4. Key is validated and used to create PrivateFeedState document

**Lesson:** The encryption private key must be available for both adding to identity AND enabling private feed. It's stored in localStorage for convenience but must be entered again if session is lost.

### Best Practices Updates

7. **Check localStorage for stored encryption keys** - For testing, encryption keys are stored at `yappr_secure_ek_<identityId>` in localStorage.

8. **Use MASTER key for identity updates on SDK dev.11** - CRITICAL key is no longer sufficient for identity modifications on the newer SDK version.

9. **Update test identity files after successful tests** - Add encryption keys and private feed status to test identity JSON files for reuse in subsequent tests.

## 2026-01-19: E2E Test 1.3 - Straightforward Test

### Issue 9: Settings Page URL Structure
**Observation:** The private feed settings are accessed via query parameter, not a separate route:
- Correct URL: `/settings?section=privateFeed`
- NOT: `/settings/private-feed` (returns 404)

**Lesson:** Check the settings page implementation for the correct URL structure. The app uses a single settings page with query params to switch between sections.

### Issue 10: DPNS Username Not Required for Testing
**Observation:** The test identity doesn't have a DPNS username registered, causing the app to redirect to `/dpns/register/`. However, clicking "Skip for now" allows access to the rest of the app.

**Lesson:** For testing purposes, DPNS username registration can be skipped. The "Skip for now" button allows full app functionality without a registered username.

### Issue 11: Console Errors for Private Followers Query
**Observation:** Console shows "Error fetching private followers: WasmSdkError" but the page still loads correctly and shows "No private followers yet".

**Possible Cause:** The PrivateFeedGrant query may have different requirements or the document type may not be properly configured on testnet.

**Impact:** Non-blocking - the UI gracefully handles the error and shows empty state.

**Lesson:** Some console errors are non-blocking and the UI handles them gracefully. Focus on visual/functional testing rather than expecting zero console errors.
